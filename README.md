# Electric Vehicle Wind Turbine Integration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a model to integrate a **wind turbine** within the bonnet of an Electric Vehicle (EV). Our current work involves creating a model to **securely and aerodynamically house the turbine** within the EV’s bonnet.

### Key Features:
- **Design Integration**: A detailed model showing how the wind turbine can be accommodated within the EV’s bonnet.
- **Aerodynamic Considerations**: Ensuring that the integration does not negatively impact the vehicle's aerodynamics or aesthetics.
- **Future Potential**: Laying the groundwork for future work on harnessing wind energy for on-the-go charging.

## Problem Statement

As Electric Vehicles (EVs) face challenges related to range anxiety and dependency on stationary charging infrastructure, there is a need for innovative solutions to extend driving range and reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources. This project aims to address these challenges by designing a model that will enable the integration of a wind turbine within the bonnet of an Electric Vehicle (EV) for energy generation.

## Proposed Solution

The project involves designing a model to **accommodate a wind turbine within the bonnet** of the EV. This design will serve as a foundation for further development of systems that capture wind energy and convert it into electrical power.

## CAD Model and Simulation

The project includes a CAD model demonstrating how the wind turbine can be integrated into the EV’s bonnet. This model provides a visual representation of the design and helps in understanding the spatial and aerodynamic considerations.
